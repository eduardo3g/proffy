# How-To 📚
Running this application is really simple. First of all you need to clone this repository to you workstation: `https://github.com/eduardo3g/proffy.git`

You're also supposed to have NPM or Yarn installed on your machine, Expo CLI and Expo Client app in your cellphone.

- NPM or Yarn - Both of them are package managers. They will be used to get all the required dependencies this project needs to run. Choose one of your
preference.
- Expo CLI - The mobile project developed with React Native depends on Expo, so go check their documentation and follow the installation steps.
- Visual Studio Code (IDE) - Download VS Code as your IDE or choose one that you enjoy the most 🚀
-

Once you have completed all the previous installation steps, it's time to run our application! Let's beggin starting the backend. <br />

In the root directory we have three folders: `server`, `web` and `mobile`. Move yourself inside each of them and run two commands: <br />
- `yarn install`: get all the dependencies
- `yarn start`: run the project
<br />

When you run the commands above inside the `mobile` directory, a new window will be opened in your default browser.
<br /><br />
After scanning the QRCode in your screen the <b>Expo Client</b> app will be opened in your cellphone running the React Native application.
<br /><br />
Just wait a few seconds to build then you're done ✅ Hope you enjoy it.
